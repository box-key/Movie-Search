## Usage

This application consists of three parts:
1) Admin - where you can add movie with its information such as title, time, cinema, and rating (Admin password is "admin").
2) Movie - where you can search for movies by rating. 
3) Cinema - where you can search for cinema by its location and rating.

First, you add movie information into the database. Then, you can see the information on Movie and Cinema screen.
